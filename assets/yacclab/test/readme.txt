Collection of synthetic images useful to test the correctness of connected components labeling algorithms 
on the most critical cases:

- images with odd number of rows and/or columns or single row/column images; 
- images with chessboard textures (i.e. maximum number of differents labels per image).

All images are in PNG format with 1 bit per pixel (0-black being background and 1-white being foreground)
and their names are listed in the "files.txt".
